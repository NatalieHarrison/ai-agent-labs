### MCP Server
The purpose of this folder is to complete an exercise from Ed Donner's AI Engineer Agentic course. The exercise was to "Make your own MCP Server! 
Make a simple function to return the current Date, and expose it as a tool so that an Agent can tell you today's date."

I did this and added a little fun in the request to the agent by asking it to not only return the current date but a fun fact of an event that happened in history on todays date.
